UFW Essentials: Common Firewall Rules and Commands

Allow and Deny (specific rules)
Allow
sudo ufw allow <port>/<optional: protocol>

Deny
sudo ufw deny <port>/<optional: protocol>

#Allow/Deny Port Ranges 
sudo ufw allow 7100:7200/tcp
sudo ufw deny 7100:7200/tcp

Delete Existing Rule
ufw deny 80/tcp
sudo ufw delete deny 80/tcp

Services
less /etc/services
#Allow by Service Name
sudo ufw allow <service name>
#Deny by Service Name
sudo ufw deny <service name>
eg:sudo ufw deny ssh


#Block an IP Address
sudo ufw deny from $IP
eg:sudo ufw deny from 15.15.15.51

#Block Connections to a Network Interface
sudo ufw deny in on eth0 from $IP
eg:sudo ufw deny in on eth0 from 15.15.15.51

Service: SSH
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 22

#Allow Incoming SSH from Specific IP Address or Subnet
To allow incoming SSH connections from a specific IP address or subnet, specify the source. For example, if you want to allow the entire 15.15.15.0/24 subnet, run this command:
sudo ufw allow from 15.15.15.0/24  to any port 22

#Allow Incoming Rsync from Specific IP Address or Subnet
Rsync, which runs on port 873, can be used to transfer files from one computer to another.
For example, if you want to allow the entire 15.15.15.0/24 subnet to be able to rsync to your server, run this command:
sudo ufw allow from 15.15.15.0/24 to any port 873

Service: Web Server
#Allow All Incoming HTTP
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow 80

#Allow All Incoming HTTPS
sudo ufw allow https
sudo ufw allow 443

#Allow All Incoming HTTP and HTTPS
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 80,443

Service: MySQL
#Allow MySQL from Specific IP Address or Subnet
sudo ufw allow from 15.15.15.0/24 to any port 3306

#Allow MySQL to Specific Network Interface
sudo ufw allow in on eth1 to any port 3306

#Allow Specific IP Addresses
ufw allow from 207.46.232.182

#Allow Specific IP Addresses on Specific port 
ufw allow from 64.63.62.61 to any port 22

#Allow by specific port, IP address and protocol
sudo ufw allow from <target> to <destination> port <port number> proto <protocol name>
example: allow IP address 192.168.0.4 access to port 22 using TCP
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.4 to any port 22 proto tcp

#Allow Subnets 
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 3306

#Allow Connections to a Specific Network Interface
sudo ufw allow in on eth2 to any port 3306

Deny connections
sudo ufw deny from 23.24.25.0/24
sudo ufw deny from 23.24.25.0/24 to any port 80
sudo ufw deny from 23.24.25.0/24 to any port 443
