#Allow Incoming SSH from Specific IP Address or Subnet
To allow incoming SSH connections from a specific IP address or subnet, specify the source. For example, if you want to allow the entire 15.15.15.0/24 subnet, run this command:
sudo ufw allow from 15.15.15.0/24  to any port 22

#Allow Incoming Rsync from Specific IP Address or Subnet
Rsync, which runs on port 873, can be used to transfer files from one computer to another.
For example, if you want to allow the entire 15.15.15.0/24 subnet to be able to rsync to your server, run this command:
sudo ufw allow from 15.15.15.0/24 to any port 873
